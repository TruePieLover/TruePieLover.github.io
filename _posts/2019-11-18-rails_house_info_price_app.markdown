For my portfolio project I created a Model Controller/View app with Ruby on Rails and similar technologies. I used VSCode as my IDE and ubuntu/command prompt for testing and release. The application uses the current versions of ruby and rails/sqlite3 and properly authenticates users while checks if the user is logged in. If no one is logged in it will show a create acount option. 

The application allows users to post information and manage their content for their houses they want to sell. The app allows users to edit/delete their posts and show information such as the offering price, pictures, and other house information.

The app is built through a house and information controller that works with the user controller authentication.
